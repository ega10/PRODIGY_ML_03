# PRODIGY_ML_03
Project Title: Image Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Overview:
This project implements a machine learning solution to classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The images are preprocessed and feature extraction is done using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The model is trained on the extracted features to classify images into two categories: Cat and Dog.

Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV
Scikit-learn
HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
NumPy
TQDM (for progress bars)
Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
Dataset:
This project uses the "Cats vs Dogs" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is split into two categories:
Cat
Dog
